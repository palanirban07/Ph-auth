This is a simple todo app project using Nuxt js based on vue js. In this project I have also used firebase for authentication. Using firebase login into the homepage using Phone Number & OTP. In the homepage I have made a todo-list app for a user to create a todo list. If necessary the user can also update & delete the list.
